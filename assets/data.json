He avoided any sort of personal attacks on Donald Trump and largely steered clear of clashing with the race's front-runner at all.  It worked. (It also helped that Rubio had a hometown crowd ready to cheer his every word.) Watching Rubio on Thursday night, I found myself wondering where he might have been in this race if he hadn't a) had brain-lock in the debate just before the New Hampshire primary and b) hadn't spent 72 hours earlier this month getting in the gutter with Trump. Of course, that's besides the point now. Rubio's last hope in the race is to win Florida, denying Trump the state's 99 delegates and praying that, somehow, the race changes drastically and puts him back in the mix. It's a long shot. But Rubio deserves credit for performing extremely well when the chips were down.",

Gone were references to \"Little Marco\" and \"Lyin' Ted\" and the general rhetorical nastiness that has been a Trump hallmark since he announced his candidacy. And, Trump was, largely, given a pass by the other men on the stage. Rubio, clearly scorched by his collapse in the wake of his juvenile attacks on Trump, wanted no piece of him. John Kasich, with a campaign built on hope and optimism, ignored Trump. Ted Cruz occasionally engaged Trump -- trying to paint him as a policy simpleton -- but the real estate mogul refused to take the bait.  So, that was the good side. Scroll down for the bad side.",

Don't promote -- with your countdown clock no less! -- that the debate begins at 8:30 pm eastern time only to tell viewers (ok, me) when they tune in that \"right at the top of the 9 pm hour\" things will get started. I, of course, get that CNN is making a ratings calculation here. They are betting that even if you are annoyed at their ruse -- you know, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfeVF9QjHlQ\">their cunning attempt to trick you</a> -- you'll be too lazy to change the channel because you know it's only 30 more minutes until the debate starts. And, it works (on me). Still, CNN. Can't we all just act like grown ups? <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/OZZYMjdP3ee\">Come on, man. What are we doing out here, man</a>?",
